    <h2>WHAT IS A SLOW LORIS?</h2>
    
        <p class="whatisp">Slow lorises are a small nocturnal primate species found in southeast Asia. With a reputation for cuteness, they are fast becoming an exotic pet that people want to have – but read on to find out why this is not a good idea (and also it is illegal in most countries)!

        <p>Length varies based on the species—slow lorises can range from the Pygmy (19-22cm in length) to the Coucang (27-38cm in length).

        <br>
        Slow lorises are famous for their large eyes, making them look “cute”. They are fur-covered little primates, with a lighter strip down the center of their face. Their heads are rounded, with hidden ears under a thick layer of fur. Their tails are covered in fur as well, and are stumpy. Each slow loris species has slightly different color variations and weights.

        <h3>An unusual characteristic of the slow loris is their venomous bite, a rarity among mammals.</h3>
        <p>Slow lorises carry a toxin that is released from the brachial gland on the sides of its elbows – when threatened, the loris will take the toxin into its mouth and mix it with saliva, activating the poison and causing a deadly bite. This toxin is also applied to the fur during grooming as a further measure of protection against predators. Their bite is harmful to humans and can cause a full-blown anaphylactic reaction (mouth swelling, chest and abdomen pain, nausea, shortness of breath, weakness and agitation), which is why they are dangerous to have as pets, despite their cuteness.</p>

        <p>Slow lorises are located primarily in southeast Asia, specific regions based on the species of slow loris. 
        <br>
        <br>
            <em>N. bengalensis</em> has the largest territory range of its genus, found in Myanmar, Cambodia, southern China, northeast India, Laos, Thailand, Vietnam, and Bangladesh. 
        <br>
        <br>
            <em>N. coucang</em> is found in Singapore.

    <h2 class="behaviorheading">BEHAVIOR</h2>
        <p class="behaviorp">
        Slow lorises are an independent species, and like living alone, although they have been known to form small groups. Males are highly territorial and they communicate by scent marking. 
            <br>
            <br>
        They are a nocturnal species and start their “daily” routines around sunset, which includes being alone most of night. They sleep very little at night – that activity is reserved for during the day. In the daytime, they find a sleeping spot (some estimates indicate that one slow loris may have as many as 60 different sleeping sites!) and roll up in a ball in a hidden part of a tree. 
            <br>
            <br>
        Predators of these adorable creatures include pythons, hawk-eagles, and orangutans. As a whole, the species moves very slowly and deliberately; when threatened, they stop moving and remain motionless. A general rule of thumb (or arm) is to always have 3 of their 4 appendages attached to whatever they are moving on. 
            <br>
            <br>
        Slow lorises are omnivores, and consume small animals, fruits, tree gum, sap, nectar, and other vegetation.

    <h2>RELATIONSHIP WITH HUMANS</h2>
    
    <p class="relationshipp">Each of the slow loris species is listed as either “vulnerable” or “endangered” on the IUCN red list, due to habitat loss and illegal trade on the exotic animal market. Due to their “cuteness”, slow lorises have quickly become YouTube stars, despite it being illegal in most countries to own them as pets. As they are naturally nocturnal animals, being kept in brightly lit rooms and in small cages is incredibly uncomfortable and unnatural for them. </p>
